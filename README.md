# UGAHackathon
Project for UGA Hacks 11
Contributors: Trey Bell, Dylan Dela-Vega, Lucas O'Connor, William Myers
This project for UGA Hacks 11 is great for college students adjusting to life away from home. The app allows users to post requests for help from fellow users as well as allowing users to offer to help by responding to those post requests. Each post includes brief details about the job that needs to be done and a rating of how difficult it would be. This is perfect as it allows people to get free help from people nearby them.
